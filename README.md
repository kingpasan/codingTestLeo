# LeoVegasUK Native Candidate Task

This is a butchered version of an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

Fire up the app for details of the test task ü¶Å

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## Add the explaination of your changes here ü¶Å

#### 1 - After installing project dependencies i have tried to run the mobile app and got several warnings related to Expo version mismatches,

Warnings -

```
The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
expo@52.0.40 - expected version: ~52.0.46
expo-router@4.0.19 - expected version: ~4.0.21
expo-splash-screen@0.29.22 - expected version: ~0.29.24
expo-system-ui@4.0.8 - expected version: ~4.0.9
react-native@0.76.7 - expected version: 0.76.9
Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.
```

This will lead to bugs, build failures, or unexpected behavior in future so i decided to upgrade the listed dependencies to match the expected versions.
